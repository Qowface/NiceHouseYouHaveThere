=====================
A simple Bukkit plugin to prevent some forms of griefing by players and mobs.

What exactly does it do?
------------------------
It prevents the following:

* Explosion block damage from TNT, Creepers, Fireballs, and Wither Skulls.
* Block destruction by the Ender Dragon and Wither.
* The spread of fire.
* Enderman block movement.
* Silverfish stone destruction.
* Sheep grass consumption.

Everything can be enabled/disabled in the config. All protections are enabled by default.
